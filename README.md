# dots-boxes
An implementation of the game dots and boxes with computer AI

For the graphics it uses Jonh Zelle's graphics.py from the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates) which can be found at http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py

The program is split into two parts: game1.py and board.py. board.py contains the code for a gameboard class which is used to construct the game in game1.py. game1.py also contains code which actually runs the game and code for the AI to follow.
